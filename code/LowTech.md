# Low Tech Navigation
[In French](./LowTech_FR.md)

The world has been discovered by boats. And at that time, electricity was mostly - if not only - available through thunderstorms.  
Navigators (like Columbus, Cook, and others) used at their time **no-tech** navigation.  
The techniques they were using still work today, and would certainlly deserve not to be forgotten. But this section is about something else, it is about using modern technologies, from small and cheap instruments.  
You need to master the technology in order too put it to work.  
And this is all the different between a tool and a black-box. The black box decides on its own, and when it decides to fail, you're screwed. The tool does what it is told to. If it does not work, it's probably because it's not been used as it should. And that can probably be fixed.
