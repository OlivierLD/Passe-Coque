                Learn to scull, it's an ancestral technique, which has proven itself, and which must not be lost, 
                it must be passed on!<br/>
                Non-polluting, efficient, no greenhouse gas emissions, silent, elegant... Quite the opposite of an outboard engine!

        The scull was invented in regions where the wood needed to make oars does not grow. 
        This wood had to be imported from the regions where it grows, which had a notable influence on the price of a pair of oars...<br/>
        Hence the very simple idea (yet another one): if you can move your boat with just one oar, it will cost half as much!<br/>
        The result is surprising... When you scull, the oar is in the water all the time, propulsive and efficient, which is not the case when you row, 
        where the oars are out of the water half the time. The scull thus turns out to be the most effective of the options...<br/>
        For the same reason, <a href="http://alternav.com" target="Alternav">Alex de Roquefeuil</a> builds sculling oars from recycled windsurfing masts. 
        And his oars are real bombs!

        <h2>End of March 2024</h2>
        We're going to build a sculling platform, with the advices of Alex de Roquefeuil.
