        <h2>The boat</h2>
        The Selection&nbsp;37 sailboat is a racing-cruising monohull, built by the Jeanneau shipyard. This sailboat, designed by naval architect Michel Joubert, measures 10.87 m long. 
        Production started in 1984 and ended in 1991. 250 examples of the boat were produced.
        It was designed for the Tour de France under sail (which Jimmy <!--Pahun -->, Pordin Nancq's referent, won 3 times!)
        Imagine was built in 85.
        It is under construction in Ouistreham until the end of spring 2024
