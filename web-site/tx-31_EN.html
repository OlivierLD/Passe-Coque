                    <h3>A few Arp&egrave;ges for a Choral navigation!</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Arp&egrave;ge from the Dufour shipyards is a legendary boat in the development of pleasure boating in France. <br/>
                        Designed by Michel Dufour, it was built in more than 1500 copies. <br/>
                        The Arp&egrave;ge was released in 1967. At the Boat Show that year, 
                        it was the Arp&egrave;ge that was a great success, which was unexpected because its price was high compared to other boats in its category. 
                        This sailboat would quickly become the emblem of the Dufour brand, allowing it to become the leading 
                        French and then European manufacturer. It would undergo only a few transformations during the 9 years it was built. <br/>
                        The transom was reversed in 1970, and the deck plan modified in 1974. Passe-Coque therefore naturally received many 
                        proposals for refits from Arp√©ge. So much so that a small fleet was set up and will be accessible at the Boat Club 
                        from next spring. 3 boats are already part of this fleet including <a href="/?nav-to=4&boat-id=rozen-an-avel">Rozen An Avel</a> which is destined to become a <a href="/?nav-to=4&boat-id=heure-bleue">Hublow</a>, a house boat.<br/>
                         But also the <a href="/?nav-to=4&boat-id=heure-bleue">Heure Bleue</a>, a project initiated by Laurent Brochard and taken over by Charles Emile known as the Admiral and 
                         Penny Lane with Thibault Bailleul who restored it to its former glory in no time! The rest of the score very soon at the launch 
                         of the Heure Bleue and Penny Lane.
